## Text-Clustering

In this repository we perform an unsupervised machine learning task by clustering the BBC News dataset based on their content. The dataset, as you will see has a news category feature which will serve as a metric for evaluating our model performance at the end, in addition to the SilhouetteScore.

2 techniques were used:
- TextVectorization to map strings to integer indices
- Pre-trained encoder model to generate embeddings
<br/>
with both techniques compared to make a case for why pre-trained embeddings should be the go-to for NLP tasks.

In summary, by using a pre-trained Universal encoder, my Kmeans model was able to predict cluster labels which matched the news category with a 96% accuracy!
